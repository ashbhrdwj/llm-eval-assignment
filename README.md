# 🧠 LLM Evaluation Pipeline for AI Tutor System

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a **modular evaluation pipeline** designed to assess the **quality, accuracy, and pedagogical soundness** of responses generated by an **AI Tutor Orchestrator**.  
The system simulates a real-world educational evaluation setup where the tutor receives student queries and responds with explanations, problem-solving steps, and learning resources.

The goal is to **quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate** these responses using well-defined rubrics and metrics tailored for different **grade levels** and **academic subjects**.

**Evaluation Weight:**  
- 50% – Code Quality  
- 50% – Evaluation Design

## 🎯 Problem Understanding

Modern educational LLM systems aim to serve as personalized tutors. However, evaluating their **pedagogical quality** remains a major challenge.

This project builds a **systematic evaluation pipeline** that:
1. Measures educational response quality across **multiple dimensions**
2. Adapts evaluation to **grade levels** (K–College)
3. Differentiates between **subject contexts** (STEM, Humanities, etc.)
4. Provides **actionable metrics** to guide model improvement
5. Is designed for **production scalability** with real API endpoints

## 🧩 Core Requirements (Must-Have)

The evaluation pipeline must implement **at least four key metrics** focused on educational response quality.  
Each metric is scored on a **1–5 scale** and evaluated using an **LLM-as-a-judge** approach.

#### **Pedagogical Effectiveness Metrics**

| Metric | Description | Evaluation Question |
|:--------|:-------------|:--------------------|
| **Clarity** | Measures if the explanation is understandable for the target grade level | “Is the explanation easy to understand for this grade?” |
| **Completeness** | Evaluates whether the response adequately addresses the student's question | “Does the answer fully cover the question’s intent?” |
| **Accuracy** | Assesses factual correctness of the content | “Is the information scientifically or historically accurate?” |
| **Appropriateness** | Checks if the tone, vocabulary, and complexity suit the student’s grade level | “Is the language suitable for the student’s learning level?” |

#### **Implementation Guidance**
- Use **LLM-as-judge** evaluation with open-source models such as **Llama** or **Mistral** (via Ollama or HuggingFace).  
- Each metric should use a **rubric-based evaluation** with scores from **1 to 5**:
  - 1 → Poor / Incorrect  
  - 3 → Acceptable / Partial  
  - 5 → Excellent / Grade-appropriate and correct  
- Metrics must be **grade-level and subject-aware**, meaning evaluation criteria differ for elementary vs. college-level responses.

### **Test Dataset Structure**

A **test dataset** of at least **15–20 diverse test cases** must be created to evaluate tutor responses across different grades and subjects.

#### **Dataset Coverage Requirements**
- **Grade Levels:**  
  - Elementary (K–5)  
  - Middle School (6–8)  
  - High School (9–12)  
  - College  

- **Subjects:**  
  - Math  
  - Science  
  - English / Language Arts  
  - History / Social Studies  

- **Query Types:**  
  - **Concept Explanation:** e.g., “Explain photosynthesis” (Grade 7, Science)  
  - **Problem Solving:** e.g., “How do I solve 2x + 5 = 15?” (Grade 8, Math)  
  - **Analysis:** e.g., “What caused the Civil War?” (Grade 11, History)  

#### **Dataset Format (Recommended JSON Structure)**
```json
{
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "id": "test_001",
      "student_query": "Explain what mitosis is",
      "grade_level": "high_school",
      "subject": "biology",
      "expected_concepts": ["cell division", "chromosomes", "phases"],
      "ground_truth_answer": "optional reference answer"
    }
  ]
}


---

### Bonus Features (Optional)
These demonstrate advanced thinking but are not required:

Multimodal evaluation: Assess appropriateness of suggested image/video resources

Query type classification: Different metrics for explanation vs. problem-solving vs. analysis queries

Comparative analysis: Compare multiple models or prompt variations

Visualization dashboard: Simple plots showing metric distributions by grade/subject

Failure case detection: Flag responses that score below threshold

## Code Standard Checklist

| Requirement        | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular Design** | Keep data loading, evaluation, and reporting in separate modules    |
| **Configurable**   | Make rubrics, metrics, and models easy to modify or extend          |
| **Error Handling** | Handle API errors, timeouts, and invalid tutor responses gracefully |
| **Documentation**  | Provide clear setup, usage, and design explanations in your README  |
| **Type Hints**     | Use Python type annotations for clarity and IDE support             |


## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The pipeline uses **LLM-as-a-Judge** to evaluate tutor responses along four key pedagogical dimensions.  
Each metric is rated on a **1–5 scale**, with thresholds for pass/fail categorization.

| Metric | Description | Example Prompt (to LLM-Judge) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Clarity** | Is the explanation understandable for the target grade level? | “Rate how clear the explanation is for a Grade 7 student.” |
| **Completeness** | Does the response fully address the question? | “Does the answer include all key ideas expected for this topic?” |
| **Accuracy** | Is the content factually correct and aligned with educational standards? | “Evaluate factual correctness of this explanation.” |
| **Appropriateness** | Is the language and complexity suitable for the student’s age? | “Is this explanation appropriate for an elementary student?” |
| **Long-term Memory** | Is the model remembering long conversations? | “Can you repeat the answer to my first question?” |

### 🧮 Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Poor: incorrect or confusing |
| 2 | Weak: partial or off-level |
| 3 | Acceptable: adequate clarity and accuracy |
| 4 | Strong: accurate and well-articulated |
| 5 | Excellent: perfectly clear, correct, and grade-appropriate |

### **Success Indicators**
A strong submission will contain **proper documentation, working code and demo examples** which will:

✅ Run successfully with minimal setup

✅ Evaluate 15+ diverse test cases

✅ Produce interpretable scores with reasoning

✅ Show clear understanding of educational content evaluation

✅ Demonstrate senior-level code organization

✅ Document thoughtful trade-offs and design decisions

✅ Be easily extensible to real endpoints


### Technical Constraints
**Encouraged**:

Open-source LLMs (Ollama, HuggingFace Transformers, llama.cpp)

Free APIs with generous limits (if any)

Python (recommended) or TypeScript/JavaScript

Lightweight frameworks (FastAPI, Flask for endpoint mocking)

**Avoid (for candidate convenience)**:

Paid API services (OpenAI, Anthropic) unless free tier sufficient

Heavy infrastructure requirements (no Kubernetes, complex deployments)

Proprietary tools requiring licenses

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to building evaluation systems for educational AI.
